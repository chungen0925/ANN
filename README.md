# ANN
Imported a dataset from Kaggle to analyze customer churn for a bank.
Focused on developing a neural network for this analysis.
Initially, imported standard libraries and then the dataset to visualize the data.
Processed categorical data within the dataset.
Utilized Keras for building the neural network model.
Employed Stochastic Gradient Descent for training the neural network.
Compiled the neural network.
Trained the model using the training dataset.
